# My Project - Online Art Journal 

#### The concept of this webiste is that a registered user can maintain an online personal art journal and document their progress over time as an artist. They can make collections of up to 6 images (stretch goal is up to 10) and add a journal entry describing this collection. Journal entries can be about any relevant information they want about their progress so far, materials and mediums they used, the time it took, tutorials they may have watched, refrences they may have used, etc. Basically the poster can blog about anything for their collection, then other users can comment and like these posts. An explore page will be a stretch goal, it will feture all the sites users posted collections which can be individually viewed. The profile view and edit page may be a stretch goal as well. Other features include: 
##### Read, Edit, Delete Posted Collections 
##### Login and Registration is Required/Validated 
##### Present Day Post Validaiton 
##### Session Check and Unique Email Validation 
##### Static Content like Images, CSS, and JS 
##### Public Deployment
